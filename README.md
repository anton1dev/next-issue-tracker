# Issue Tracker (Next.js + Tailwind CSS + RadixUI + Prisma + Vercel)
I have created a full-stack web application that allows users to organize all issues and jobs relevant to them these days.

# Tech stack
During development process, I've used best JS technologies:
- *Next.js* - proficiency Full-Stack JS framework based on ***React*** best practicies;
- *TailwindCSS* - easy to use, powerful and smart CSS library for quickly using inline styles;
- *Prisma* - ORM, that allows to create, update & use models within a couple of minutes to setup;
- *Sentry* - extremely powerful web service to track, manage and correct errors & bugs;
- *Radix UI* - smart kit, which helps to build high-quality, accessible web apps.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
